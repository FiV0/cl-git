A short list of items that need to be done.

* Remove CFFI namespaces
* Move all foreign-funcall's into defcfun 
   this is so translations can be used and there is a consistant
   location for defined functions.
* Move all groups of funcitons into separate files
   Probably following the libgit2 breakdown
* Reorder the files from low-level to high-level functions
* Change all loops to use the keyword syntax
